# UK Pension Calculator

An interactive calculator to help you understand and optimize your pension contributions through salary sacrifice - one of the most tax-efficient ways to save for retirement in the UK.

## Features

- **Salary Sacrifice Analysis**: See how pension contributions affect your take-home pay and tax savings
- **Real-time Calculations**: Interactive sliders and inputs with immediate feedback

## Why Use This Calculator?

Salary sacrifice pension contributions are highly tax-efficient because:

1. Contributions are taken before tax and National Insurance
2. You save both Income Tax AND National Insurance (unlike regular pension contributions)
3. The first 25% of pension withdrawals is tax-free
4. The rest is taxed as income, often at a lower rate than when you were working
